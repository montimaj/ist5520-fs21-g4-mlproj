    "## 1.1 Problem description and Research Questions\n",
    "This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (Nox) emissions from different cars operating in the United Kingdom. We will also be analyzing the factors having the most impact on such emissions. In addition, we will compare different machine learning models to assess their performance on the dataset. In this regard, the following research question needs to be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> Which predictors are statistically significant for predicting the CO and NOx emissions? </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some specific research questions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>a.  Which machine learning model works best for this data set?</i> \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>b. Which cars perform well (in terms of emissions) in both urban and extra-urban driving conditions?</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Regression Analysis\n",
    "The car emissions data set is a regression-based data set where we need to predict the CO and NOx emissions based on the explanatory variables In this project, we are dealing with a multivariate regression problem that is concerned with both prediction and inference wherein we have two output predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Potential problems and Challenges\n",
    "The major challenge in this project is to perform feature engineering. There are some highly correlated variables (THC+NOx, particulates)and some variables variables which may be not be useful directly. For example, the 'Model' and 'Decription' features are highly non-atomic containing several car information (Engine Type, Tire Size, Horsepower, Car Make Year, etc.). Thus, appropriate data-preprocessing and feature engineering needs to be performed for addressing the above research questions.\n",

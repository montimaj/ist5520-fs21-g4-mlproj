    "## 1.1 Problem description and Research Questions\n",
    "This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission score from different vehicles operating in the United States. We will also be analyzing the factors having the most impact on this score which varies from 1 (worst) to 10 (best). In addition, we will compare different machine learning models to assess their performance on the data sets. Essentially, this is a classification problem wherein we will utilize the EPA vehicle and emission data sets to predict the EPA emission score (a discrete quantity). Such kind of modeling and analysis if pushed to a production environment could enable policymakers in addressing critical issues in the sustainable transportation industry. In this regard, the following research question needs to be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> Which predictors are statistically significant for predicting the EPA emission score? </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some specific research questions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>a.  Which machine learning model works best for this data set?</i> \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>b. Which cars perform well (in terms of emissions) in both city and highway driving conditions?</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Classification Analysis\n",
    "The vehicle and car emissions data sets can be used to model a classification problem where we need to predict the EPA emission score (a unitless quantity have integral values in the [1,10] interval) based on the explanatory variables In this project, we are dealing with a high-dimensional classification problem that is concerned with both prediction (discrete EPA emission score) and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Potential problems and Challenges\n",
    "The major challenge in this project is to perform feature engineering. Appropriate data-preprocessing and feature engineering need to be performed to reduce the data dimensionality required to suitably address the above research questions.\n",

    "\n",
    "This dataset can be found at https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml. The vehicle and emission data sets need to be linked based on the vehicle ID. The vehicle data set contains 83 explanatory variables (columns) that provide detailed car specifications and has 44075 rows. As for the emissions data set, it has 8 features and 42442 rows. \n",

    "## 2.2 Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "We found this data set on [EPA fuel economy portal](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/). The EPA has generated [annual reports](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/pdfs/guides/FEG2021.pdf) but there are no existing publicly available notebooks having detailed machine learning workflows. Moreover, these two data sets in conjunction satisfy all the other project requirements ($\\ge$20 columns and $\\ge$1000 rows) listed as part of this group assignment.  "
